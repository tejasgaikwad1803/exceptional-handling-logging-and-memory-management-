        "  ->\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is used to manage errors during program execution. Instead of crashing, we use try and except blocks to catch errors like ZeroDivisionError and keep the program running smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The finally block runs no matter what — whether there is an error or not.\n",
        "It is used to clean up things like closing files or releasing resources\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Logging in Python means writing messages about what the program is doing. It helps you find and fix errors by showing useful info, like when something went wrong or what step the program is on. It’s better than using print() for big programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The __del__ method is called when an object is deleted. It is used to clean up resources like closing files or connections before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> import brings in the whole module, so you use module.function().\n",
        "\n",
        "from ... import lets you bring specific parts, so you can use function() directly without the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> You can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple except blocks for different errors.\n",
        "Or, you can catch multiple exceptions in one line using a tuple like: except (TypeError, ValueError):.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The with statement is used to open files safely. It automatically closes the file after the work is done, even if an error happens, so you don’t need to call file.close().\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Multithreading :\n",
        "\n",
        "Runs multiple threads in the same process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads share memory and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good for I/O-bound tasks (like file reading, network requests).\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster to start, but can be limited by Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).\n",
        "\n",
        "Less memory usage than multiprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing :\n",
        "\n",
        "Runs in separate processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each process has its own memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Best for CPU-bound tasks (like data processing, calculations).\n",
        "\n",
        "Slower to start but can use multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses more memory but avoids GIL issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Logging helps track the flow of a program and find bugs easily. It records useful messages, errors, or warnings without stopping the program, and is better than using print() for real projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Memory management in Python means handling memory automatically so programs run smoothly. Python uses a garbage collector to free up unused memory and stores data using private heaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> First, write code inside a try block where an error might happen. Then use except to catch and handle the error. Optionally, use else to run code if there’s no error, and finally to run cleanup code every time.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Memory management is important to keep programs fast and efficient. It helps avoid memory leaks by automatically removing unused data, so the system doesn’t slow down or crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The try block contains code that might cause an error. If an error happens, the except block catches it and runs alternate code, so the program doesn’t crash\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Python’s garbage collector automatically removes objects that are no longer used to free up memory. It mainly uses reference counting and also checks for unused objects in cycles using a built-in module called gc.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The else block runs only if no error happens in the try block. It’s used to write code that should run when everything goes fine, without any exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Python has five main logging levels:\n",
        "\n",
        "DEBUG – for detailed info (used for debugging)\n",
        "\n",
        "INFO – for general messages\n",
        "\n",
        "WARNING – for something that might cause a problem\n",
        "\n",
        "ERROR – for serious problems\n",
        "\n",
        "CRITICAL – for very serious errors\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> os.fork() directly creates a child process (Unix/Linux only) and is low-level.\n",
        "\n",
        "multiprocessing is a higher-level module that works on all platforms and makes it easier to create and manage multiple processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Closing a file frees up system resources and saves any changes made to the file. If you don’t close it, data might not be written properly or the file could get corrupted.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->  file.read() :\n",
        "\n",
        "Reads entire file content at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns a single string with all the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can use a number as an argument to limit characters (e.g., file.read(10)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses more memory if the file is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good for small files you want to read fully.\n",
        "\n",
        "file.readline() :\n",
        "\n",
        "Reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns a string of just that line, including the newline \\n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Useful in loops to read line-by-line.\n",
        "\n",
        "More memory-efficient for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good when you only need one line or want to process lines one by one.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The logging module is used to record messages about what a program is doing. It helps track errors, warnings, or other events, and is better than using print() for debugging or saving logs.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The os module helps interact with the operating system. It’s used for file handling tasks like creating, deleting, renaming files or folders, and checking file paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Python’s memory management is automatic, but challenges include memory leaks from unused references, slow cleanup of circular references, and high memory use in large programs. Developers must still write efficient code to avoid these issues\n",
        "\n",
        "24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> You can raise an exception using the raise keyword.\n",
        "For example: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\") will stop the program and show the error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Multithreading helps run multiple tasks at the same time in a single program. It’s useful for applications like downloading files, handling user input, or running background tasks without slowing down the main program\n",
